				beginning commitments of higher liquidity yields, they collapsed while Retik Finance remained steadfast.</p>

				with more than $109B TVL is going through a change itself, from evidence of-work to completely verification of-stake
				agreement with the forthcoming Guide Chain consolidation. Accordingly, Ethereum gas charges have not been
				reasonable, to say the least.</p>
